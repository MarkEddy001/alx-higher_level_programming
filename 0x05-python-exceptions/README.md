# 0x05 Python Exceptions

This project is designed to help you understand and practice working with exceptions in Python. You will learn how to handle errors and exceptions, raise exceptions, and work with different types of Python objects. Below are the tasks included in this project:

## Tasks

### Task 0: Safe list printing

Write a Python function that prints elements of a list with error handling using `try` and `except`. The function should return the real number of elements printed. You cannot use `import`, and you cannot use `len()`.

### Task 1: Safe printing of an integers list

Create a function that prints an integer using `"{:d}".format()`, with error handling to check if the value is an integer.

### Task 2: Print and count integers

Write a function that prints the first x integers from a list. Non-integer elements should be skipped in silence, and you need to handle exceptions for cases where x exceeds the list length.

### Task 3: Integers division with debug

Create a function that divides two integers and prints the result. Use `try`, `except`, and `finally` to handle exceptions and print the result.

### Task 4: Divide a list

Write a function that divides two lists element-wise and returns a new list. Handle different cases, including division by zero, non-integer or non-float elements, and list length issues.

### Task 5: Raise exception

Create a function that raises a type exception without using any imports.

### Task 6: Raise a message

Write a function that raises a name exception with a custom message.

### Task 7: Safe integer print with error message (Advanced)

Develop a function that prints an integer, and if it fails, it prints an error message to stderr.

### Task 8: Safe function (Advanced)

Create a function that executes another function safely, handling exceptions and printing error messages to stderr.

### Task 9: ByteCode -> Python #4 (Advanced)

Implement a Python function that replicates the behavior of a given Python bytecode.

### Task 10: CPython #2: PyFloatObject (Advanced)

Create C functions that provide information about Python lists, bytes, and float objects and print the details about them.

## How to Use

Each task has its own Python script, and you can execute these scripts to test the functionality. Make sure to follow the instructions provided in the task descriptions.
